# C12-Feed-The-Rabbit-Project
Shailey loves rabbits. She wants to create a game in which a rabbit can eat different leaves and carrots. We have already helped Shailey create the game's design with a moving background and a rabbit. Now she wants to make the game a bit challenging. She wants to spawn apples at random positions. Are you up for the challenge?
